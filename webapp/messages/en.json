    "subtitle": "How ShopControl AI works under the hood",
    "overview": "ShopControl AI is built on n8n workflows that orchestrate two main systems: a fully autonomous AI email support agent with RAG knowledge retrieval and automated financial reporting. Here we show step by step how each email inquiry is processed.",
    "workflow": {
      "title": "The Workflow in 6 Steps",
      "step1": {
        "title": "Email Retrieval",
        "description": "The workflow starts by retrieving all new emails from Gmail. From each email thread, only the latest message is extracted, as it contains the current customer inquiry. This ensures that in ongoing conversations, the most recent message is always processed."
      },
      "step2": {
        "title": "Filtering",
        "description": "In the second step, all emails are automatically filtered. Promotional emails, automated notifications, and newsletters are sorted out. An AI checks whether the remaining messages are genuine support requests. Additionally, emails are checked for policy violations. Only genuine, appropriate customer inquiries proceed further."
      },
      "step3": {
        "title": "Image Analysis",
        "description": "If images are attached to the email, such as photos of damaged products, they are analyzed separately by an AI. The system recognizes what is shown in the images and creates a textual description as additional context for the support agent."
      },
      "step4": {
        "title": "Support Agent Processing",
        "description": "The AI support agent processes the inquiry. It takes the email text along with any image descriptions and autonomously decides which tools it needs — e.g., the Shopify agent for order data or the RAG knowledge base for return policies. Based on all collected information, it generates a well-founded response."
      },
      "step5": {
        "title": "Email Dispatch",
        "description": "Before the response is sent, it passes through an automatic security check (Output Guardrails) that verifies the response is correct, complete, and appropriately worded. Only after this validation passes is the reply email actually sent."
      },
      "step6": {
        "title": "Performance Logging",
        "description": "In the final step, the entire process is documented: which inquiry came in, which tools were used, what was answered, and how long processing took. This performance data is stored in Google Sheets, enabling long-term monitoring and optimization."
      }
    },
    "rag": {
      "title": "RAG System",
      "subtitle": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Detail",
      "description": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enables the AI agent to access company-specific knowledge. Documents like FAQs, product catalogs, and return policies are converted into vectors and stored in the Pinecone vector database. With each inquiry, the most relevant text passages are automatically found, ranked by a reranker for relevance, and provided to the agent as context. An embedding model converts texts into mathematical representations, so the search works by meaning rather than exact words.",
