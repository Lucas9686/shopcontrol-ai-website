# Requirements: v1.1 Content Accuracy & Deploy Fix

## Deploy Fix

- [ ] **DEPLOY-01**: Vercel build succeeds — git tracks files correctly so webapp/ root directory works

## Content Accuracy — Technology Page

- [ ] **TECH-01**: 6 workflow steps match report section 5.2 exactly (E-Mail-Abruf, Filterung, Bild-Analyse, Support-Agent-Verarbeitung, E-Mail-Versand, Performance-Logging)
- [ ] **TECH-02**: Each step description matches report sections 5.2.1–5.2.6
- [ ] **TECH-03**: Each step screenshot maps to correct workflow section from report figures
- [ ] **TECH-04**: Security section shows all 4 layers (Jailbreak Detection, NSFW Filter, Topical Alignment, Output Guardrails)
- [ ] **TECH-05**: Tools section shows correct 3 tools (Chat Memory/PostgreSQL, Shopify-Agent, Support-Fall-Agent/Sheets-Agent)
- [ ] **TECH-06**: RAG section description matches report section 5.3 (Pinecone, Cohere Reranker, embedding model)

## Content Accuracy — Solution Page

- [ ] **SOL-01**: Accounting pillar description matches report chapter 6 (financial KPI reporting via WhatsApp, data from Shopify/Facebook Ads/bank — NOT invoice generation)
- [ ] **SOL-02**: Tech stack shows correct technologies from report Table 7.1 (Claude/GPT not just OpenAI, Supabase for DB, Cohere Reranker, WhatsApp API, Telegram)

## Content Accuracy — Cross-Page

- [ ] **CROSS-01**: Support agent consistently described as E-Mail-based (not chat widget) across all pages

## OG Image

- [ ] **OG-01**: Replace placeholder OG image with branded version

## Performance

- [ ] **PERF-01**: Lighthouse audit and optimization pass
