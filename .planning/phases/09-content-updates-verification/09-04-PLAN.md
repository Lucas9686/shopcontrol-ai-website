<objective>
Fix content discrepancies found during research: correct vector DB from Qdrant to Pinecone, add Claude alongside GPT, verify About page accuracy. Do a systematic pass over all translations to catch remaining errors.

Purpose: CONTENT-02 (Technology verification), CONTENT-03 (About verification), CONTENT-04 (all text verified against PDFs).
Output: Corrected translations, verified content accuracy.

Key discrepancies from research:
- Vector DB: Website says "Qdrant" → PDF says "Pinecone" (HIGH severity)
- LLM: Website says "OpenAI GPT-4o" → PDF says "Claude / GPT" (MEDIUM severity)
- Reranker: Website says "Cohere Reranker" → PDF says just "Reranker" (LOW severity)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix Technology page discrepancies</name>
  <files>webapp/messages/de.json, webapp/messages/en.json</files>
  <action>
In both DE and EN translation files, find and fix these in the `technology` section:

1. **Vector DB (HIGH):** Find any reference to "Qdrant" and replace with "Pinecone". This includes:
   - `technology.techStack.qdrant` key — rename to `pinecone` if the key name matters, or just change the display text to "Pinecone" and description to "Vektordatenbank für semantische Suche" / "Vector database for semantic search"
   - Any description mentioning Qdrant

2. **LLM (MEDIUM):** Find `technology.techStack.openai` or similar. Change from just "OpenAI GPT-4o" to "Claude & GPT" or "Anthropic Claude + OpenAI GPT" — the system uses both models. Update description accordingly.

3. **Reranker (LOW):** If "Cohere Reranker" is mentioned, simplify to just "Reranker" without brand name, matching PDF wording.

Also check `technology/page.tsx` — if it references any hardcoded tech names (not from translations), fix those too.

Search systematically: `grep -rn "Qdrant\|qdrant\|GPT-4o\|Cohere" webapp/` to find all occurrences.
  </action>
  <verify>`cd webapp && grep -rn "Qdrant\|qdrant" messages/ app/` returns no results. `grep -n "Pinecone\|pinecone" messages/de.json` returns at least one match.</verify>
  <done>Technology content matches PDF: Pinecone as vector DB, Claude+GPT as LLMs, Reranker without brand.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify About page and do final content sweep</name>
  <files>webapp/messages/de.json, webapp/messages/en.json, webapp/app/[locale]/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. **About page verification:** Read `about` section in de.json and en.json. Verify against PROJECT.md:
   - Author: Lucas Nessel
   - School: HTL Klagenfurt Lastenstraße, Abteilung Mechatronik
   - Supervisors: Mag. Albin Weiss B.Sc., MMag. Dr. Mario Kraiger
   - Single-person project (Einzelarbeit)
   Fix any discrepancies found.

2. **Final content sweep:** Grep through de.json for any remaining inaccuracies:
   - Search for "ae", "oe", "ue" patterns that might be leftover ASCII umlauts (e.g., "Ueberblick" should be "Überblick")
   - Verify support-agent page mentions email-based support (not chat)
   - Verify accounting page mentions WhatsApp KPI reporting
   - Check that no page still references removed routes (/problem, /solution)

Fix any issues found. Document what was checked and confirmed correct.
  </action>
  <verify>`cd webapp && npx next build` succeeds. `grep -n "Qdrant\|/problem\|/solution" messages/de.json messages/en.json` returns empty.</verify>
  <done>About page verified correct. All content across site verified against PDFs. No factual errors remain.</done>
</task>

1. Build succeeds
2. No references to Qdrant anywhere in codebase
3. Pinecone correctly referenced as vector DB
4. Claude + GPT both mentioned as LLMs
5. About page has correct school, supervisors, author info
6. No ASCII umlaut remnants (ae/oe/ue patterns in German text)
7. No broken route references (/problem, /solution)

<success_criteria>
- All HIGH/MEDIUM discrepancies from research are fixed
- About page content verified accurate
- Systematic sweep confirms no remaining factual errors
- Build passes, all pages load correctly
