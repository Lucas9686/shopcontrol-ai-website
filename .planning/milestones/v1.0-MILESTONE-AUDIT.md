- Smooth scroll wraps all pages via layout

| Results page with charts | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Foundation & Layout
- Missing VERIFICATION.md (low impact — deliverables exist and work)
- Missing 01-02-SUMMARY.md (low impact — documentation gap only)

### Phase 4: Polish & Media
- Missing VERIFICATION.md (low impact — deliverables confirmed by integration check)
- Demo video uses placeholder YouTube ID (`dQw4w9WgXcQ`) — **needs replacement before presentation**
- OG image may be generic placeholder — should be branded

### Total: 5 items across 2 phases
