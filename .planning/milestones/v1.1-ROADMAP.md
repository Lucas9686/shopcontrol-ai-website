# Milestone v1.1: Content Accuracy & Deploy Fix

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-31
**Phases:** 5-6
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Fix Vercel deployment, correct all content inaccuracies against the report, and optimize performance.

## Phases

### Phase 5: Deploy Fix & Content Accuracy

**Goal**: Website deploys successfully on Vercel and all page content matches the Jugend Innovativ report exactly
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: DEPLOY-01, TECH-01, TECH-02, TECH-03, TECH-04, TECH-05, TECH-06, SOL-01, SOL-02, CROSS-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `vercel build` succeeds with webapp/ as root directory and site is live
  2. Technology page shows exactly 6 workflow steps matching report section 5.2 with correct names, descriptions, and screenshots
  3. Technology page security section lists all 4 layers, tools section shows correct 3 tools, and RAG section matches report 5.3
  4. Solution page accounting pillar describes WhatsApp-based KPI reporting (not invoice generation) and tech stack matches report Table 7.1
  5. Support agent is described as E-Mail-based (not chat widget) on every page that mentions it
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Fix git tracking (remove root ghost files, add webapp/ to git)
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Correct all content inaccuracies (technology steps, security, tools, RAG, accounting, tech stack, chatbot refs)

### Phase 6: OG Image & Performance

**Goal**: Website has branded social sharing image and scores well on Lighthouse
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: OG-01, PERF-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Sharing a page URL on social media / messaging apps shows a branded ShopControl AI preview image (not placeholder)
  2. Lighthouse performance score is 90+ on mobile for the home page
  3. No render-blocking resources or unoptimized images flagged by Lighthouse
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Generate branded OG image and replace placeholder logo
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Lighthouse performance optimization (image opt, next/image, smooth scroll)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- ASCII-safe German text in JSON (consistent with codebase, avoids encoding issues)
- Agent is email-based, not chat-based (matches report description)
- Accounting = financial KPI reporting via WhatsApp (matches report section 4.6)
- Lenis autoRaf instead of manual RAF loop (cleaner lifecycle management)
- Keep original PNGs alongside WebP (originals not actively referenced by components)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Vercel build failure: Root Directory "webapp" did not exist in git (52 ghost files at root)
- Content inaccuracies: workflow steps, security layers, tools, accounting description all corrected
- All chatbot/chat-widget references eliminated
- Placeholder OG image and text logo replaced with branded versions
- Lighthouse performance optimized (sharp, WebP, Lenis autoRaf)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Replace placeholder YouTube demo video ID (when video is recorded)
- Delete orphaned hero.tsx component
- Update component references to use WebP instead of PNG

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- WebP images created but components still reference PNGs (suboptimal ~2MB extra)
- Orphaned hero.tsx component references deleted headshot images
