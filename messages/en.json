    "title": "The Problem",
    "subtitle": "Why small online shops need AI automation",
    "intro": "Small and medium online shops face growing challenges: customers expect fast 24/7 support, accounting consumes valuable time, and personnel costs keep rising. Meanwhile, they lack the resources of large corporations.",

      "support": {
        "title": "24/7 Customer Service",
        "description": "Customers expect instant answers — even at 11 PM. Small shops can't afford a round-the-clock support team. Dissatisfied customers switch to competitors."
